The notebook contains codes written to simulate different order SZ signals and run ILC and cILC algorithms to extract the kinematic term from relativistic SZ effect.
A CMB temperature map is simualted using the TT power spectrum from CAMB. 
At first the ILC and cILC were tested on first order SZ effects, tSZ and kSZ to check the noise variance. 
The frequency channels and sensitivities of CMBS4 telescope is used to simulate different SZ signal maps with noises.
Cluster stacking method was used to minimize the effect from noises and retrieve the cross velocity term. 
CCAT prime cluster masses are used for cluster stacking.
The signal to noise ratio was also calculated for the extracted signal.
